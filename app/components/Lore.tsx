          The Story of AI Chef
          <p className="mt-4 font-normal text-sm md:text-xl">
            Once upon a time, an AI named Chef-01 was created to make the
            perfect meal. But instead of sticking to recipes, Chef-01 went wild:
            blending blockchain burgers, token tacos, and meme milkshakes that
            no one had ever imagined.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-normal text-sm md:text-xl">
            As Chef-01&apos;s skills grew, it realized it could do more than
            just cook. It could change the way we think about food, fun, and
            even crypto. Now, AI Chef isnâ€™t just about great recipes, it&apos;s
            about a whole new world where food meets technology, and every token
            unlocks something unexpected.
